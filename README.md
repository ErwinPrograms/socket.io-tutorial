## Socket.io

## Installation

This project requires Node.js to be installed on your machine. If you do not have Node.js installed, you can find the [official Node.js installer here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Alternatively, you can install nvm to quickly install and switch between Node.js versions.
 - [Windows nvm repository](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
 - [MacOS/Linux nvm repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

This repository contains both the client and server folders. Each section would have to be installed and run independently.

### Client Installation

1. Navigate to client folder: 
> `C:\...\socket.io-tutorial\client>`
1. Install all node modules by inputting an npm install command:
> `npm install`
1. After installation is complete, run the start script:
> `npm run start`
1. A new window should open for localhost:8080 and the client should attempt to connect to the server. Every tab with localhost:8080 open will try to independently connect to the server.

### Server Installation

1. Navigate to server folder:
> `C:\...\socket.io-tutorial\client`
1. Install all node modules by inputting an npm install command:
